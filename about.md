## Mind the Machine is a space for thinking about artificial intelligence before it thinks too much—or too confidently.


I am a Business Intelligence (BI) Architect with 18+ years of experience delivering enterprise-scale BI and analytics systems across domains such as Finance, CRM, and Marketing.


My professional work spans analytics platforms, data warehousing, and decision systems — including designing, operating, and sustaining BI solutions across on-premise and cloud environments.


Alongside core BI and analytics work, I focus on applied AI and automation, including AI-assisted development and the use of LLMs in data workflows, metadata creation, data governance, and system behavior analysis.


My writing explores how intelligent systems behave under real-world constraints — particularly quiet failures, loss of internal evaluation, coherence, balance, and stability — where systems appear to perform well while gradually drifting toward breakdown.


My essays have been published with Towards AI and reflect a practical interest in understanding limits, failure modes, and why intelligence alone is insufficient in deployed systems.



These ideas are written to invite discussion — especially with teams building, deploying, and operating real-world AI and analytics systems.
