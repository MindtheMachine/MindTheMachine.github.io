# Mind the Machine

Mind the Machine is a space for thinking about artificial intelligence before it thinks too much — or too confidently.

I am a Business Intelligence (BI) Architect with 18+ years of experience delivering enterprise-scale BI and analytics systems across domains such as Finance, CRM, and Marketing.

My professional work spans analytics platforms, data warehousing, and decision systems, including the design, operation, and long-term sustainment of BI solutions across both on-premise and cloud environments.

Alongside core BI and analytics work, I focus on applied AI and automation — particularly AI-assisted development and the use of large language models (LLMs) in data workflows, metadata creation, data governance, and system behavior analysis.

My writing explores how intelligent systems behave under real-world constraints, especially quiet failures, loss of internal evaluation, and the erosion of balance, coherence, and stability — cases where systems appear to perform well while gradually drifting toward breakdown.

My essays have been published with *Towards AI* and reflect a practical interest in understanding limits, failure modes, and why intelligence alone is insufficient in deployed systems.

These ideas are written to invite discussion, particularly with teams building, deploying, and operating real-world AI and analytics systems.
